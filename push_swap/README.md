## PUSH_SWAP ðŸš€

In this project we must create a program that takes a list of numbers and stores in a stack (for the sake of understanding we will call it stack a). Then, using another empty stack (stack b) me must sort the stack a by numeric order.
But in order to to do this we only are allowed the following movements between the stacks:
- sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
- sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
- ss : sa and sb at the same time.
-pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
-pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
-ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
-rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
-rr : ra and rb at the same time.
-rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
-rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
-rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.

In addition our program must sort the stack nodes using the lowest number of operations we can get (the lowest the operations, the higher the grade we get)

* Allowed functions: read, write, malloc, free, exit
